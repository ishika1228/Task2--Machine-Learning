🌸 Data Visualization & EDA on the Iris Dataset
🚀 A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization project on the Iris dataset, using Python. The project involves data exploration, cleaning, and visualization techniques to understand the relationships between different iris flower species.

📌 Project Overview
This project explores the Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning. It contains measurements of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The main tasks include:
✅ Data Exploration – Summarizing dataset statistics.
✅ Data Cleaning – Handling missing values and inconsistencies.
✅ Data Visualization – Using matplotlib & seaborn to create histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and box plots.
✅ Feature Analysis – Identifying key features that separate the species.

📂 Dataset
📍 Dataset Name: Iris Dataset
📍 Features Included:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 🐍

🎯 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration
Load the dataset using pandas.
Check for missing values and handle them.
Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Check for inconsistencies in data types.
Normalize/scale numerical values if needed.
3️⃣ Data Visualization
📊 Univariate Analysis

Histograms – Distribution of each feature.
Box Plots – Identify outliers in sepal/petal measurements.
📊 Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Scatter Plots – Relationship between features.
Pair Plots – Visualizing species separation.
Violin Plots – Distribution comparison of different species.
4️⃣ Insights & Observations
Key findings on feature relationships.
Differences between species based on feature measurements.
📊 Key Takeaways
✔ Clear patterns in petal length and width for species classification.
✔ Setosa species is easily separable compared to Versicolor and Virginica.
✔ Petal width & petal length are strong indicators for classification.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Apply classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) for species prediction.
🔹 Use interactive visualizations with Plotly.
🔹 Build a web dashboard to display visualization results.
